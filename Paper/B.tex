\section{B}

In this section, we first describe a simple SDA based neighbor discovery 
algorithm for the synchronous scenario. 
Then we propose a ADA based neighbor discovery algorithm for the 
asynchronous scenario without and with collision detection mechanism respectively. 
Then we give the performance  analysis and derive the upper bound.
