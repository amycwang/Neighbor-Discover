Neighbor discovery is a fundamental step in constructing wireless sensor networks and many algorithms have been proposed to minimize discovery latency. However, few of them can be applied to an energy-restricted large-scale network, which is more appealing and promising due to the development of intelligent devices. 
In an energy-restricted large-scale network, a node has limited power supply and can only discover nodes within it's range; additionally, the discovery process may fail if surplus communication exists on the wireless channel. These factors make neighbor discovery a challenging task in establishing the networks.

In this paper, we propose Alano, a nearly optimal algorithm for a large-scale network on the basis of nodes' distributions.
When nodes have similars energy constraints, we modify Alano by Relaxed Difference Set (RDS) (denote as RDS-Alano); while we present a Traversing Pointer (TP) based Alano (denote as TP-Alano) when the energy constraints are different. We compare Alano with the state-of-the-art protocols through extensive evaluations, and the results show that Alano achieves at least $31.35\%$ lower discovery latency and it has higher performance regarding quality (discovery rate) and scalability.% and robustness.
