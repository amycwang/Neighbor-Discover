The conclusion goes here.
With different duty cycle, Fig. 8 shows that Alano has lower latency. Compared with Aloha, Alano has from 53.66\% to 11.23 times lower latency. The latency of Alano and Aloha generally decreases as the duty cycle increases, while Hello, Hedis and Searchlight have high latency due to the collision. In normal distribution, Alano has a small twist with duty cycle 0.35, because when the duty cycle increases, nodes are more likely to transmit and therefore collide.
