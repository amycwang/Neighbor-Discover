\section{A}

In this section, we propose a synchronous duty-time alignment (SDA) algorithm, 
a probabilistic approach to construct duty schedule in the synchronous scenario, 
as well as an asynchronous duty-time alignment (ADA) algorithm in the asynchronous scenario.
Then we give the performance  analysis and derive the upper bound.
