Main components in this section:

\textbf{1.Research Background:}

\textbf{2.The weakness of the existing methods and the challenge:}

The existing methods can be divided into two categories :  deterministic or probabilistic.

The deterministic approaches assume there are no collision or are only suitable for two nodes.
Some assume all the nodes are the neighbor of each other.

The probabilistic approaches have a poor performance and can not guarantee a worst case bound. 


Challenge of my work:
We consider the most demanding problem model in this work, which is also closest to the practical situation.

\textbf{3.The main contribution and key idea of my work:}

Consider the partially-connected network, which is the most demanding problem model.

Combine the advantages of both two category approaches.

The Proposed algorithm guarantees achieving neighbor discovery within $O(nf(\theta))$, which holds a better
performance than the state-of-the-art works.

The core is to propose a deterministic approach to  align the sensors' wake-up time and then achieve neighbor discovery with a probabilistic approach.
