% P1:    
% General background
% The situation&scenario our research applies to
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment \cite{zeadally2012energy} has exploded 
on the scene in the last twenty years, leading to an obvious ascent of Internet-of-Things \cite{atzori2010internet},
such as wireless sensor networks[], mobile campus networks[], mobile gaming community[], etc.


% P2: 
% Why NB problem is related and important to the background in P1  
% Define what is neighbor and what is neighbor discovery problem
% A brief introduction of the existing works
Neighbor discovery is a fundamental step of constructing a wireless network, based on 
which the network can implement further applications such as routing and broadcasting.
The core target is for each node in the network to discover the nodes in its radio sensing range 
with one-hop communication, which are called neighbors. 
A number of existing methods \cite{dutta2008practical,kandhalu2010u,
bakht2012searchlight,sun2014hello,chen2015heterogeneous,
wang2015blinddate,qiu2016talk,mcglynn2001birthday,
vasudevan2009neighbor,you2011aloha,song2014probabilistic} have been proposed 
to deal with this issue, some of which are based on deterministic techniques while others
are probabilistic approaches.


% P3:
% Crucial problem:  existing network models are impractical
% What is the current network model
Unfortunately, there are some discrepancies between the current research network and the actual situation.
The deterministic methods deal with the neighbor discovery problem for two nodes and the
probabilistic approaches are designed for the networks where all the nodes can communicate with each other.


% P4:
% What is a practical network model and define what is a partially-connected network
In a large-scale and practical network, each node is only able to sense the 
nodes located nearby itself based on received signal strength \cite{wang2013gaussian}.  
We call this network connection structure as partially-connected networks.


% P5: 
% What issues will occur, if transferring the existing methods (mentioned in P2) to the partially-connected network
As for the deterministic approaches, when transferred to partially-connected networks,
they can not solve the collision issue when more than one neighbors are transmitting simultaneously. 
Relatively, the probabilistic approach can well deal with multiple nodes discovery but only consider
the network is fully-connected, the topology of which is a complete graph. 
Thus the probability adopted in these approaches can not be desirable.


% P6: 
% Summarize and highlight the crucial issue : partially-connected network and practical distribution
% Give the reason why it is import to take the distribution into consideration
To our best knowledge, no relevant researches have focused on neighbor discovery problem
in the partially-connected networks. More practically, in a wireless sensor network the distribution of 
sensors' deployment consequently plays a vital role in determining the intrusion detection capability of a sensor node.
Thus the distribution of the nodes in the network needs to be fully taken into 
consideration.

% P7:
% Our solution/contribution : we propose Alano algorithm based on the distribution of nodes for the partially-connected networks
In this paper, we propose Alano\footnote{Alano is the god of luck in Greek mythology }, 
a nearly optimal probability based algorithm to discover neighbors in partially-connected networks. 
As fully studied in \cite{wang2013gaussian} , the nodes in wireless sensor networks are likely to 
follow a uniform or a Gaussian distribution as showed in Fig. \ref{distribution}, 
depending on the specific network applications, which is  in consideration of the proposed Alano algorithm.

% P8: 
% A special type of partially-connected networks: energy-efficient network
In addition, among the partially-connected networks, there is a special 
type named energy-efficient network.
Wireless sensor network is a typical energy-efficient network that all the sensor nodes have to maintain 
strict power budgets to attain years of lifetime\cite{dunkels2011contikimac}.
Duty cycle mechanism, the fraction of time the radio is turned on, is 
utilized to raise the power-awareness of the nodes in the network.
Correspondingly, the neighbor discovery process 
needs adjustment to deal with the dilemma between 
a balance of energy-efficiency and low-latency.


% P9: 
% For energy-efficient networks, we propose RDS-Alano in global duty cycle scenario 
% and TP-Alano in the local duty cycle scenario.
For energy-efficient networks, we design deterministic methods
to align the wake-up time slot between the neighbors to achieve lower latency bound.
Specifically, We propose RDS-Alano algorithm for the global duty cycle scenario, where 
all the nodes share a identical duty cycle $\theta$ and TP-Alano for the
local duty cycle scenario where each node holds a distrinct duty cycle $\theta_i$. 


% P10:
% Simulation results support our high performance
Our simulation under the practical distribution of networks 
\cite{wang2013gaussian} shows the proposed Alano algorithm
holds significant strengths than the state-of-the-art methods,
based on the evaluation of speed, quality and scalability.
Alano achieves 31.35\% to 32.32 times lower latency
and has higher discovery rate during the whole course of neighbor discovery, 
with either global or local duty cycle in both uniform and Gaussian distribution.
When the number of nodes increases and the network becomes denser, 
Alano still keeps its high performance. 


% P11:

\begin{itemize}
\item[1)] We model the distribution of node deployment with mathematical analysis 
and analyse the expectation number of neighbors of a node in uniform distribution and Gaussian
distribution.
